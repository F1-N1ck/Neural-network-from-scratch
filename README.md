# Neural-network-from-scratch

This project implements a fully connected neural network **from scratch** using only NumPy, without high-level frameworks. Trained on MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Two hidden layers (ReLU)
- Softmax output
- He initialization
- Cross-entropy loss
- Learning rate decay
- Mini-batch gradient descent
- Loss & accuracy plots

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
